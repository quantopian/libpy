``libpy`` is a library to help you write amazing Python extensions in C++.
``libpy`` makes it easy to expose C++ code to Python.
``libpy`` lets you automatically wrap functions and classes.
``libpy`` is designed for high performance and safety: libpy extension modules should be both faster and safer than using the C API directly.

Install
-------

To install for development:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ make

Otherwise, ``pip install libpy``, making sure ``CC`` and ``CXX`` environment variables are set to the the right compiler.

**Note**: The installation of ``libpy`` will use the ``python`` executable to
figure out information about your environment. If you are not using a virtual
environment or ``python`` does not point to the Python installation you want
to use (checked with ``which python`` and ``python --version``) you must
point to your Python executable using the ``PYTHON`` environment variable,
i.e. ``PYTHON=python3 make`` or ``PYTHON=python3 pip3 install libpy``.

Tests
-----

To run the unit tests, invoke:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ make test
